-**Start using Claude Code:**
+## What you can do
+
+Here are some of the ways you can use Claude Code:
+
+<AccordionGroup>
+  <Accordion title="Automate the work you keep putting off" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
+    Claude Code handles the tedious tasks that eat up your day: writing tests for untested code, fixing lint errors across a project, resolving merge conflicts, updating dependencies, and writing release notes.
+
+    ```bash  theme={null}
+    claude "write tests for the auth module, run them, and fix any failures"
+    ```
+  </Accordion>
 
-```bash  theme={null}
-cd your-project
-claude
-```
+  <Accordion title="Build features and fix bugs" icon="hammer">
+    Describe what you want in plain language. Claude Code plans the approach, writes the code across multiple files, and verifies it works.
 
-You'll be prompted to log in on first use. That's it! [Continue with Quickstart (5 minutes) →](/en/quickstart)
+    For bugs, paste an error message or describe the symptom. Claude Code traces the issue through your codebase, identifies the root cause, and implements a fix. See [common workflows](/en/common-workflows) for more examples.
+  </Accordion>
 
-<Tip>
-  See [advanced setup](/en/setup) for installation options, manual updates, or uninstallation instructions. Visit [troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting) if you hit issues.
-</Tip>
+  <Accordion title="Create commits and pull requests" icon="code-branch">
+    Claude Code works directly with git. It stages changes, writes commit messages, creates branches, and opens pull requests.
 
-Claude Code also runs in [VS Code](/en/vs-code), [JetBrains IDEs](/en/jetbrains), as a [desktop app](/en/desktop), [on the web](/en/claude-code-on-the-web), and in [Slack](/en/slack). See [all platforms](#use-claude-code-everywhere) below.
+    ```bash  theme={null}
+    claude "commit my changes with a descriptive message"
+    ```
 
-## What Claude Code does for you
+    In CI, you can automate code review and issue triage with [GitHub Actions](/en/github-actions) or [GitLab CI/CD](/en/gitlab-ci-cd).
+  </Accordion>
 
-* **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
-* **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
-* **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/en/mcp) can pull from external data sources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
-* **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
+  <Accordion title="Connect your tools with MCP" icon="plug">
+    The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/mcp) is an open standard for connecting AI tools to external data sources. With MCP, Claude Code can read your design docs in Google Drive, update tickets in Jira, pull data from Slack, or use your own custom tooling.
+  </Accordion>
 
-## Why developers love Claude Code
+  <Accordion title="Customize with instructions, skills, and hooks" icon="sliders">
+    [`CLAUDE.md`](/en/claude-md) is a markdown file you add to your project root that Claude Code reads at the start of every session. Use it to set coding standards, architecture decisions, preferred libraries, and review checklists.
 
-* **Meets you where you work**: Use Claude Code in your terminal, your IDE, or a standalone desktop app. It integrates with the tools you already use.
-* **Takes action**: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](/en/mcp) lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use *your* custom developer tooling.
-* **Unix philosophy**: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` *works*. Your CI can run `claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
-* **Enterprise-ready**: Use the Claude API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade [security](/en/security), [privacy](/en/data-usage), and [compliance](https://trust.anthropic.com/) is built-in.
+    Create [custom slash commands](/en/skills) to package repeatable workflows your team can share, like `/review-pr` or `/deploy-staging`.
 
-## Use Claude Code everywhere
+    [Hooks](/en/hooks) let you run shell commands before or after Claude Code actions, like auto-formatting after every file edit or running lint before a commit.
+  </Accordion>
 
-Claude Code works across your development environment: in your terminal, in your IDE, in the cloud, and in Slack.
+  <Accordion title="Run agent teams and build custom agents" icon="users">
+    Spawn [multiple Claude Code agents](/en/sub-agents) that work on different parts of a task simultaneously. A lead agent coordinates the work, assigns subtasks, and merges results.
 
-* **[Terminal (CLI)](/en/quickstart)**: the core Claude Code experience. Run `claude` in any terminal to start coding.
-* **[Claude Code on the web](/en/claude-code-on-the-web)**: use Claude Code from your browser at [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) or the Claude iOS app, with no local setup required. Run tasks in parallel, work on repos you don't have locally, and review changes in a built-in diff view.
-* **[Desktop app](/en/desktop)**: a standalone application with diff review, parallel sessions via git worktrees, and the ability to launch cloud sessions.
-* **[VS Code](/en/vs-code)**: a native extension with inline diffs, @-mentions, and plan review.
-* **[JetBrains IDEs](/en/jetbrains)**: a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, and other JetBrains IDEs with IDE diff viewing and context sharing.
-* **[GitHub Actions](/en/github-actions)**: automate code review, issue triage, and other workflows in CI/CD with `@claude` mentions.
-* **[GitLab CI/CD](/en/gitlab-ci-cd)**: event-driven automation for GitLab merge requests and issues.
-* **[Slack](/en/slack)**: mention Claude in Slack to route coding tasks to Claude Code on the web and get PRs back.
-* **[Chrome](/en/chrome)**: connect Claude Code to your browser for live debugging, design verification, and web app testing.
+    For fully custom workflows, the [Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) lets you build your own agents powered by Claude Code's tools and capabilities, with full control over orchestration, tool access, and permissions.
