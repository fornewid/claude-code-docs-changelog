 ## Use extended thinking (thinking mode)
 
-[Extended thinking](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) is enabled by default, reserving a portion of the output token budget (up to 31,999 tokens) for Claude to reason through complex problems step-by-step. This reasoning is visible in verbose mode, which you can toggle on with `Ctrl+O`.
