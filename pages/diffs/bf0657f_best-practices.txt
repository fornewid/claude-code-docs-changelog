+There are three main ways to run parallel sessions:
 
 * [Claude Desktop](/en/desktop): Manage multiple local sessions visually. Each session gets its own isolated worktree.

+* [Agent teams](/en/agent-teams): Automated coordination of multiple sessions with shared tasks, messaging, and a team lead.
 
 Beyond parallelizing work, multiple sessions enable quality-focused workflows. A fresh context improves code review since Claude won't be biased toward code it just wrote.
