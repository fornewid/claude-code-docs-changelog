 ### Hook configuration
 
-**Managed settings only**: Controls which hooks are allowed to run. This setting can only be configured in [managed settings](#settings-files) and provides administrators with strict control over hook execution.
+These settings control which hooks are allowed to run and what HTTP hooks can access. The `allowManagedHooksOnly` setting can only be configured in [managed settings](#settings-files). The URL and env var allowlists can be set at any settings level and merge across sources.
 
 **Behavior when `allowManagedHooksOnly` is `true`:**
 
 * Managed hooks and SDK hooks are loaded
 * User hooks, project hooks, and plugin hooks are blocked
 
-**Configuration:**
+**Restrict HTTP hook URLs:**
+
+Limit which URLs HTTP hooks can target. Supports `*` as a wildcard for matching. When the array is defined, HTTP hooks targeting non-matching URLs are silently blocked.
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "allowedHttpHookUrls": ["https://hooks.example.com/*", "http://localhost:*"]
+}
+```
+
+**Restrict HTTP hook environment variables:**
+
+Limit which environment variable names HTTP hooks can interpolate into header values. Each hook's effective `allowedEnvVars` is the intersection of its own list and this setting.
 
 ```json  theme={null}
 {
-  "allowManagedHooksOnly": true
+  "httpHookAllowedEnvVars": ["MY_TOKEN", "HOOK_SECRET"]
 }
 ```
