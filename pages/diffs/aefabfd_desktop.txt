-The Code tab in the Desktop app lets you use Claude Code through a graphical interface instead of the terminal. You get visual diff review with inline comments, permission modes that control how much Claude does on its own, parallel sessions with automatic Git isolation, and connectors that integrate tools like GitHub, Slack, and Linear. Sessions can run locally, on a remote machine over [SSH](#ssh-sessions), or in [the cloud](#run-long-running-tasks-remotely).

 Enterprise admins can restrict which permission modes are available. See [enterprise configuration](#enterprise-configuration) for details.
 
+### Preview your app
+
+Claude can start a dev server and open an embedded browser to verify its changes. This works for frontend web apps as well as backend servers: Claude can test API endpoints, view server logs, and iterate on issues it finds. In most cases, Claude starts the server automatically after editing project files. You can also ask Claude to preview at any time. By default, Claude [auto-verifies](#auto-verify-changes) changes after every edit.
+
+From the preview panel, you can:
+
+* Interact with your running app directly in the embedded browser
+* Watch Claude verify its own changes automatically: it takes screenshots, inspects the DOM, clicks elements, fills forms, and fixes issues it finds
+* Start or stop servers from the **Preview** dropdown in the session toolbar
+* Persist cookies and local storage across server restarts by selecting **Persist sessions** in the dropdown, so you don't have to re-login during development
+* Edit the server configuration or stop all servers at once
+
+Claude creates the initial server configuration based on your project. If your app uses a custom dev command, edit `.claude/launch.json` to match your setup. See [Configure preview servers](#configure-preview-servers) for the full reference.
+
+To clear saved session data, toggle **Persist preview sessions** off in Settings → Claude Code. To disable preview entirely, toggle off **Preview** in Settings → Claude Code.

+### Review your code
+
+In the diff view, click **Review code** in the top-right toolbar to ask Claude to evaluate the changes before you commit. Claude examines the current diffs and leaves comments directly in the diff view. You can respond to any comment or ask Claude to revise.
+
+The review focuses on high-signal issues: compile errors, definite logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and obvious bugs. It does not flag style, formatting, pre-existing issues, or anything a linter would catch.
+
+### Monitor pull request status
+
+After you open a pull request, a CI status bar appears in the session. Claude Code uses the GitHub CLI to poll check results and surface failures.
+
+* **Auto-fix**: when enabled, Claude automatically attempts to fix failing CI checks by reading the failure output and iterating.
+* **Auto-merge**: when enabled, Claude merges the PR once all checks pass. The merge method is squash. Auto-merge must be [enabled in your GitHub repository settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository) for this to work.
+
+Use the **Auto-fix** and **Auto-merge** toggles in the CI status bar to enable either option. Claude Code also sends a desktop notification when CI finishes.

+### Configure preview servers
+
+Claude automatically detects your dev server setup and stores the configuration in `.claude/launch.json` at the root of the folder you selected when starting the session. Preview uses this folder as its working directory, so if you selected a parent folder, subfolders with their own dev servers won't be detected automatically. To work with a subfolder's server, either start a session in that folder directly or add a configuration manually.
+
+To customize how your server starts, for example to use `yarn dev` instead of `npm run dev` or to change the port, edit the file manually or click **Edit configuration** in the Preview dropdown to open it in your code editor. The file supports JSON with comments.
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "version": "0.0.1",
+  "configurations": [
+    {
+      "name": "my-app",

+      "runtimeArgs": ["run", "dev"],
+      "port": 3000
+    }
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+You can define multiple configurations to run different servers from the same project, such as a frontend and an API. See the [examples](#examples) below.
+
+#### Auto-verify changes
+
+When `autoVerify` is enabled, Claude automatically verifies code changes after editing files. It takes screenshots, checks for errors, and confirms changes work before completing its response.
+
+Auto-verify is on by default. Disable it per-project by adding `"autoVerify": false` to `.claude/launch.json`, or toggle it from the **Preview** dropdown menu.
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "version": "0.0.1",
+  "autoVerify": false,
+  "configurations": [...]
+}
+```
+
+When disabled, preview tools are still available and you can ask Claude to verify at any time. Auto-verify makes it automatic after every edit.

+
+##### When to use `program` vs `runtimeExecutable`
+
+Use `runtimeExecutable` with `runtimeArgs` to start a dev server through a package manager. For example, `"runtimeExecutable": "npm"` with `"runtimeArgs": ["run", "dev"]` runs `npm run dev`.
+
+Use `program` when you have a standalone script you want to run with `node` directly. For example, `"program": "server.js"` runs `node server.js`. Pass additional flags with `args`.
+
+#### Port conflicts
+
+The `autoPort` field controls what happens when your preferred port is already in use:
+
+* **`true`**: Claude finds and uses a free port automatically. Suitable for most dev servers.
+* **`false`**: Claude fails with an error. Use this when your server must use a specific port, such as for OAuth callbacks or CORS allowlists.
+* **Not set (default)**: Claude asks whether the server needs that exact port, then saves your answer.
+
+When Claude picks a different port, it passes the assigned port to your server via the `PORT` environment variable.
+
+#### Examples
+
+These configurations show common setups for different project types:
+
+<Tabs>
+  <Tab title="Next.js">
+    This configuration runs a Next.js app using Yarn on port 3000:
+
+    ```json  theme={null}
+    {
+      "version": "0.0.1",
+      "configurations": [
+        {
+          "name": "web",
+          "runtimeExecutable": "yarn",
+          "runtimeArgs": ["dev"],
+          "port": 3000
+        }
+      ]
+    }
+    ```
+  </Tab>
+
+  <Tab title="Multiple servers">
+    For a monorepo with a frontend and an API server, define multiple configurations. The frontend uses `autoPort: true` so it picks a free port if 3000 is taken, while the API server requires port 8080 exactly:
+
+    ```json  theme={null}
+    {
+      "version": "0.0.1",
+      "configurations": [
+        {
