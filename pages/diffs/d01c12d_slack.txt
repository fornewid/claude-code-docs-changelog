+### Channel-based access control
+
+Claude is not automatically added to any channels after installation. Users must explicitly invite Claude to channels where they want to use it:
+
+* **Invite required**: Type `/invite @Claude` in any channel to add Claude to that channel
+* **Channel membership controls access**: Claude can only respond to @mentions in channels where it has been added
+* **Access gating through channels**: Admins can control who uses Claude Code by managing which channels Claude is invited to and who has access to those channels
+* **Private channel support**: Claude works in both public and private channels, giving teams flexibility in controlling visibility
 
-Slack workspace administrators control whether the Claude app can be installed in the workspace. Individual users then authenticate with their own Claude accounts to use the integration.
+This channel-based model allows teams to restrict Claude Code usage to specific channels, providing an additional layer of access control beyond workspace-level permissions.
