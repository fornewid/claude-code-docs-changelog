 Encourage new users to try Claude Code for codebase Q\&A, or on smaller bug fixes or feature requests. Ask Claude Code to make a plan. Check Claude's suggestions and give feedback if it's off-track. Over time, as users understand this new paradigm better, then they'll be more effective at letting Claude Code run more agentically.
 
+### Pin model versions for cloud providers
+
+If you deploy through [Bedrock](/en/amazon-bedrock), [Vertex AI](/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Foundry](/en/microsoft-foundry), pin specific model versions using `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`. Without pinning, Claude Code aliases resolve to the latest version, which can break users when Anthropic releases a new model that isn't yet enabled in your account. See [Model configuration](/en/model-config#pin-models-for-third-party-deployments) for details.

 ### Configure security policies
 
 Security teams can configure managed permissions for what Claude Code is and is not allowed to do, which cannot be overwritten by local configuration. [Learn more](/en/security).
