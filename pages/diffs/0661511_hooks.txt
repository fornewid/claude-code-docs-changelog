 ## Hook lifecycle
 
-Hooks fire at specific points during a Claude Code session. When an event fires and a matcher matches, Claude Code passes JSON context about the event to your hook handler. For command hooks, this arrives on stdin. Your handler can then inspect the input, take action, and optionally return a decision. Some events fire once per session, while others fire repeatedly inside the agentic loop:

+Each object in the inner `hooks` array is a hook handler: the shell command, HTTP endpoint, LLM prompt, or agent that runs when the matcher matches. There are four types:
 
 * **[Command hooks](#command-hook-fields)** (`type: "command"`): run a shell command. Your script receives the event's [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output) on stdin and communicates results back through exit codes and stdout.
+* **[HTTP hooks](#http-hook-fields)** (`type: "http"`): send the event's JSON input as an HTTP POST request to a URL. The endpoint communicates results back through the response body using the same [JSON output format](#json-output) as command hooks.
 * **[Prompt hooks](#prompt-and-agent-hook-fields)** (`type: "prompt"`): send a prompt to a Claude model for single-turn evaluation. The model returns a yes/no decision as JSON. See [Prompt-based hooks](#prompt-based-hooks).
 * **[Agent hooks](#prompt-and-agent-hook-fields)** (`type: "agent"`): spawn a subagent that can use tools like Read, Grep, and Glob to verify conditions before returning a decision. See [Agent-based hooks](#agent-based-hooks).

+
+Claude Code sends the hook's [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output) as the POST request body with `Content-Type: application/json`. The response body uses the same [JSON output format](#json-output) as command hooks.
+
+Error handling differs from command hooks: non-2xx responses, connection failures, and timeouts all produce non-blocking errors that allow execution to continue. To block a tool call or deny a permission, return a 2xx response with a JSON body containing `decision: "block"` or a `hookSpecificOutput` with `permissionDecision: "deny"`.
+
+This example sends a `PreToolUse` event to a local validation service:
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "hooks": {
+    "PreToolUse": [
+      {
+        "matcher": "Bash",
+        "hooks": [
+          {
+            "type": "http",
+            "url": "http://localhost:8080/hooks/pre-tool-use",
+            "timeout": 30,

+### HTTP response handling
+
+HTTP hooks use HTTP status codes and response bodies instead of exit codes and stdout:
+
+* **2xx with an empty body**: success, equivalent to exit code 0 with no output
+* **2xx with a plain text body**: success, the text is added as context
+* **2xx with a JSON body**: success, parsed using the same [JSON output](#json-output) schema as command hooks
+* **Non-2xx status**: non-blocking error, execution continues
+* **Connection failure or timeout**: non-blocking error, execution continues
+
+Unlike command hooks, HTTP hooks cannot signal a blocking error through status codes alone. To block a tool call or deny a permission, return a 2xx response with a JSON body containing the appropriate decision fields.
+
 ### JSON output
 
 Exit codes let you allow or block, but JSON output gives you finer-grained control. Instead of exiting with code 2 to block, exit 0 and print a JSON object to stdout. Claude Code reads specific fields from that JSON to control behavior, including [decision control](#decision-control) for blocking, allowing, or escalating to the user.
