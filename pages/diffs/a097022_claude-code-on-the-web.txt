 ### From terminal to web
 
-Start a message with `&` inside Claude Code to send a task to run on the web:
-
-```
-& Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts

-This creates a new web session on claude.ai with your current conversation context. The task runs in the cloud while you continue working locally. Use `/tasks` to check progress, or open the session on claude.ai or the Claude iOS app to interact directly. From there you can steer Claude, provide feedback, or answer questions just like any other conversation.

-You can also start a web session directly from the command line:

 This pattern gives you control over the strategy while letting Claude execute autonomously in the cloud.
