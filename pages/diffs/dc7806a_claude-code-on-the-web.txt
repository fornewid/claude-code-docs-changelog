+Custom environment images and snapshots are not yet supported. As a workaround, you can use [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart) to install packages when a session starts. This approach has [known limitations](#dependency-management-limitations).

+* **Hooks fire for all sessions**: SessionStart hooks run in both local and remote environments. There is no hook configuration to scope a hook to remote sessions only. To skip local execution, check the `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable in your script as shown above.
+* **Requires network access**: Install commands need network access to reach package registries. If your environment is configured with "No internet" access, these hooks will fail. Use "Limited" (the default) or "Full" network access. The [default allowlist](#default-allowed-domains) includes common registries like npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and crates.io.
+* **Proxy compatibility**: All outbound traffic in remote environments passes through a [security proxy](#security-proxy). Some package managers do not work correctly with this proxy. Bun is a known example.
+* **Runs on every session start**: Hooks run each time a session starts or resumes, adding startup latency. Keep install scripts fast by checking whether dependencies are already present before reinstalling.
