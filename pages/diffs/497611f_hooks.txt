 Claude Code sends the hook's [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output) as the POST request body with `Content-Type: application/json`. The response body uses the same [JSON output format](#json-output) as command hooks.
 
 Error handling differs from command hooks: non-2xx responses, connection failures, and timeouts all produce non-blocking errors that allow execution to continue. To block a tool call or deny a permission, return a 2xx response with a JSON body containing `decision: "block"` or a `hookSpecificOutput` with `permissionDecision: "deny"`.
