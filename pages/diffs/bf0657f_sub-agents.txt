 Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent's description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results.

+  If you need multiple agents working in parallel and communicating with each other, see [agent teams](/en/agent-teams) instead. Subagents work within a single session; agent teams coordinate across separate sessions.

   When subagents complete, their results return to your main conversation. Running many subagents that each return detailed results can consume significant context.

+For tasks that need sustained parallelism or exceed your context window, [agent teams](/en/agent-teams) give each worker its own independent context.

 #### Chain subagents
 
 For multi-step workflows, ask Claude to use subagents in sequence. Each subagent completes its task and returns results to Claude, which then passes relevant context to the next subagent.
