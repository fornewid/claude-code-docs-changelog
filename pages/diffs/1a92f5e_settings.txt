 | `IS_DEMO`                                      | Set to `true` to enable demo mode: hides email and organization from the UI, skips onboarding, and hides internal commands.

 | `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`                        | Maximum number of tokens allowed in MCP tool responses. Claude Code displays a warning when output exceeds 10,000 tokens (default: 25000)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |
 | `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`                          | Override the [extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) token budget. Thinking is enabled at max budget (31,999 tokens) by default. Use this to limit the budget (for example, `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000`) or disable thinking entirely (`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0`). Extended thinking improves performance on complex reasoning and coding tasks but impacts [prompt caching efficiency](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#caching-with-thinking-blocks). |     |
+| `MCP_CLIENT_SECRET`                            | OAuth client secret for MCP servers that require [pre-configured credentials](/en/mcp#use-pre-configured-oauth-credentials).
