+### Choose an appropriate team size
+
+There's no hard limit on the number of teammates, but practical constraints apply:
+
+* **Token costs scale linearly**: each teammate has its own context window and consumes tokens independently. See [agent team token costs](/en/costs#agent-team-token-costs) for details.
+* **Coordination overhead increases**: more teammates means more communication, task coordination, and potential for conflicts
+* **Diminishing returns**: beyond a certain point, additional teammates don't speed up work proportionally
+
+Start with 3-5 teammates for most workflows. This balances parallel work with manageable coordination. The examples in this guide use 3-5 teammates because that range works well across different task types.
+
+Having 5-6 [tasks](/en/agent-teams#architecture) per teammate keeps everyone productive without excessive context switching. If you have 15 independent tasks, 3 teammates is a good starting point.
+
+Scale up only when the work genuinely benefits from having teammates work simultaneously. Three focused teammates often outperform five scattered ones.
+
 ### Size tasks appropriately
 
 * **Too small**: coordination overhead exceeds the benefit
