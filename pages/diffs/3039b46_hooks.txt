+Exit codes let you allow or block, but JSON output gives you finer-grained control. Instead of exiting with code 2 to block, exit 0 and print a JSON object to stdout. Claude Code reads specific fields from that JSON to control behavior, including [decision control](#decision-control) for blocking, allowing, or escalating to the user.

 Your hook's stdout must contain only the JSON object. If your shell profile prints text on startup, it can interfere with JSON parsing. See [JSON validation failed](/en/hooks-guide#json-validation-failed) in the troubleshooting guide.
 
-The JSON object has two parts:
+The JSON object supports three kinds of fields:
 
-* **Top-level fields** like `continue` and `decision` work across all events. These are listed in the table below.
-* **`hookSpecificOutput`** is a nested object for event-specific fields like `permissionDecision` or `additionalContext`. It requires a `hookEventName` field set to the event name, like `"PreToolUse"` or `"Stop"`. Each event's decision control section under [Hook events](#hook-events) documents what fields go here.
+* **Universal fields** like `continue` work across all events. These are listed in the table below.
+* **Top-level `decision` and `reason`** are used by some events to block or provide feedback.
