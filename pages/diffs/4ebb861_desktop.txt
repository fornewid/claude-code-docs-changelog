 <Tip title="Best practice">
   Start complex tasks in Plan mode so Claude maps out an approach before making changes. Once you approve the plan, switch to Code or Ask mode to execute it. See [explore first, then plan, then code](/en/best-practices#explore-first-then-plan-then-code) for more on this workflow.
