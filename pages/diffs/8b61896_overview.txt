 ## Why developers love Claude Code
 
-* **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
+* **Meets you where you work**: Use Claude Code in your terminal, your IDE, or a standalone desktop app. It integrates with the tools you already use.
 * **Takes action**: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](/en/mcp) lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use *your* custom developer tooling.
 * **Unix philosophy**: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` *works*. Your CI can run `claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
 * **Enterprise-ready**: Use the Claude API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade [security](/en/security), [privacy](/en/data-usage), and [compliance](https://trust.anthropic.com/) is built-in.
