 The prompt box supports several features:
 
-* **Permission modes**: Click the mode indicator at the bottom of the prompt box to switch modes. In normal mode, Claude asks permission before each action. In Plan mode, Claude describes what it will do and waits for approval before making changes. In auto-accept mode, Claude makes edits without asking. Set the default in VS Code settings under `claudeCode.initialPermissionMode`.
-* **Command menu**: Click `/` or type `/` to open the command menu. Options include attaching files, switching models, toggling extended thinking, and viewing plan usage (`/usage`). The Customize section provides access to MCP servers, hooks, memory, permissions, and plugins. Items with a terminal icon open in the integrated terminal.
-* **Context indicator**: The prompt box shows how much of Claude's context window you're using. Claude automatically compacts when needed, or you can run `/compact` manually.
-* **Extended thinking**: Lets Claude spend more time reasoning through complex problems. Toggle it on via the command menu (`/`). See [Extended thinking](/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) for details.

 ### Reference files and folders
 
 Use @-mentions to give Claude context about specific files or folders. When you type `@` followed by a file or folder name, Claude reads that content and can answer questions about it or make changes to it. Claude Code supports fuzzy matching, so you can type partial names to find what you need:
 
-```
+```text  theme={null}
 > Explain the logic in @auth (fuzzy matches auth.js, AuthService.ts, etc.)
 > What's in @src/components/ (include a trailing slash for folders)

 <Tip>
   Use the sidebar for your main Claude session and open additional tabs for side tasks. Claude remembers your preferred location. Note that the Spark icon only appears in the Activity Bar when the Claude panel is docked to the left. Since Claude defaults to the right side, use the Editor Toolbar icon to open Claude.
