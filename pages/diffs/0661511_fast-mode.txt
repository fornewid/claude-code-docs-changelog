Administrators on [Teams](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) or [Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales) plans can prevent this by setting `fastModePerSessionOptIn` to `true` in [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files) or [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings).
