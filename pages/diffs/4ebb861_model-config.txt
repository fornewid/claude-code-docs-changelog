-The `[1m]` suffix enables a [1 million token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) for long sessions.
+Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 support a [1 million token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) for long sessions with large codebases.
 
 <Note>
-  For Opus 4.6, the 1M context window is available for API and Claude Code pay-as-you-go users. Pro, Max, Teams, and Enterprise subscription users do not have access to Opus 4.6 1M context at launch.
+  The 1M context window is currently in beta. Features, pricing, and availability may change.

+
+Selecting a 1M model does not immediately change billing. Your session uses standard rates until it exceeds 200K tokens of context. Beyond 200K tokens, requests are charged at [long-context pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing) with dedicated [rate limits](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/rate-limits#long-context-rate-limits). For subscribers, tokens beyond 200K are billed as extra usage rather than through the subscription.

+### Pin models for third-party deployments
+
+When deploying Claude Code through [Bedrock](/en/amazon-bedrock), [Vertex AI](/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Foundry](/en/microsoft-foundry), pin model versions before rolling out to users.
+
+Without pinning, Claude Code uses model aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`) that resolve to the latest version. When Anthropic releases a new model, users whose accounts don't have the new version enabled will break silently.
+
+<Warning>
+  Set all three model environment variables to specific version IDs as part of your initial setup. Skipping this step means a Claude Code update can break your users without any action on your part.
+</Warning>
+
+Use the following environment variables with version-specific model IDs for your provider:
+
+| Provider  | Example                                                                 |
+| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
+| Bedrock   | `export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1'` |
+| Vertex AI | `export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='claude-opus-4-6'`                 |
+| Foundry   | `export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='claude-opus-4-6'`                 |
+
+Apply the same pattern for `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`. For current and legacy model IDs across all providers, see [Models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). To upgrade users to a new model version, update these environment variables and redeploy.
+
+<Note>
+  The `settings.availableModels` allowlist still applies when using third-party providers. Filtering matches on the model alias (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`), not the provider-specific model ID.

 ### Prompt caching configuration
 
 Claude Code automatically uses [prompt caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) to optimize performance and reduce costs. You can disable prompt caching globally or for specific model tiers:
