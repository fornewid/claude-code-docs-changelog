-The Default option in the model picker is not affected by `availableModels`. It always remains available and represents the system's runtime default based on the user's subscription tier:

 Selecting a 1M model does not immediately change billing. Your session uses standard rates until it exceeds 200K tokens of context. Beyond 200K tokens, requests are charged at [long-context pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing) with dedicated [rate limits](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/rate-limits#long-context-rate-limits). For subscribers, tokens beyond 200K are billed as extra usage rather than through the subscription.
 
 If your account supports 1M context, the option appears in the model picker (`/model`) in the latest versions of Claude Code. If you don't see it, try restarting your session.
