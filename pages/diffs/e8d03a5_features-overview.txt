 Features can be defined at multiple levels: user-wide, per-project, via plugins, or through managed policies. You can also nest CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories or place skills in specific packages of a monorepo. When the same feature exists at multiple levels, here's how they layer:
 
-* **CLAUDE.md files** are additive: all levels contribute content to Claude's context simultaneously. Files from your working directory and above load at launch; subdirectories load as you work in them. When instructions conflict, Claude uses judgment to reconcile them, with more specific instructions typically taking precedence. See [how Claude looks up memories](/en/memory#how-claude-looks-up-memories).

 * **Skills and subagents** override by name: when the same name exists at multiple levels, one definition wins based on priority (managed > user > project for skills; managed > CLI flag > project > user > plugin for subagents). Plugin skills are [namespaced](/en/plugins#add-skills-to-your-plugin) to avoid conflicts. See [skill discovery](/en/skills#where-skills-live) and [subagent scope](/en/sub-agents#choose-the-subagent-scope).
 * **MCP servers** override by name: local > project > user. See [MCP scope](/en/mcp#scope-hierarchy-and-precedence).
 * **Hooks** merge: all registered hooks fire for their matching events regardless of source. See [hooks](/en/hooks).
