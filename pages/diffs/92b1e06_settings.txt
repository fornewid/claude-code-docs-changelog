 Configure advanced sandboxing behavior. Sandboxing isolates bash commands from your filesystem and network. See [Sandboxing](/en/sandboxing) for details.

+**Filesystem and network restrictions** can be configured in two ways that are merged together:
 
-* Use `Read` deny rules to block Claude from reading specific files or directories
-* Use `Edit` allow rules to let Claude write to directories beyond the current working directory
-* Use `Edit` deny rules to block writes to specific paths
-* Use `WebFetch` allow/deny rules to control which network domains Claude can access
+* **`sandbox.filesystem` settings** (shown above): Control paths at the OS-level sandbox boundary. These restrictions apply to all subprocess commands (e.g., `kubectl`, `terraform`, `npm`), not just Claude's file tools.
+* **Permission rules**: Use `Edit` allow/deny rules to control Claude's file tool access, `Read` deny rules to block reads, and `WebFetch` allow/deny rules to control network domains. Paths from these rules are also merged into the sandbox configuration.

 For example, if your user settings allow `Bash(npm run *)` but a project's shared settings deny it, the project setting takes precedence and the command is blocked.
 
+<Note>
+  **Array settings merge across scopes.** When the same array-valued setting (such as `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` or `permissions.allow`) appears in multiple scopes, the arrays are **concatenated and deduplicated**, not replaced. This means lower-priority scopes can add entries without overriding those set by higher-priority scopes, and vice versa. For example, if managed settings set `allowWrite` to `["//opt/company-tools"]` and a user adds `["~/.kube"]`, both paths are included in the final configuration.

 ### Verify active settings
 
 Run `/status` inside Claude Code to see which settings sources are active and where they come from. The output shows each configuration layer (managed, user, project) along with its origin, such as `Enterprise managed settings (remote)`, `Enterprise managed settings (plist)`, `Enterprise managed settings (HKLM)`, or `Enterprise managed settings (file)`. If a settings file contains errors, `/status` reports the issue so you can fix it.
