+#### Granting subprocess write access to specific paths
+
+By default, sandboxed commands can only write to the current working directory. If subprocess commands like `kubectl`, `terraform`, or `npm` need to write outside the project directory, use `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` to grant access to specific paths:
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "sandbox": {
+    "enabled": true,
+    "filesystem": {
+      "allowWrite": ["~/.kube", "//tmp/build"]
+    }
+  }
+}
+```
+
+These paths are enforced at the OS level, so all commands running inside the sandbox, including their child processes, respect them. This is the recommended approach when a tool needs write access to a specific location, rather than excluding the tool from the sandbox entirely with `excludedCommands`.
+
+When `allowWrite` (or `denyWrite`/`denyRead`) is defined in multiple [settings scopes](/en/settings#settings-precedence), the arrays are **merged**, meaning paths from every scope are combined, not replaced. For example, if managed settings allow writes to `//opt/company-tools` and a user adds `~/.kube` in their personal settings, both paths are included in the final sandbox configuration. This means users and projects can extend the list without duplicating or overriding paths set by higher-priority scopes.
+
+Path prefixes control how paths are resolved:
+
+| Prefix            | Meaning                                     | Example                                |
+| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- |
+| `//`              | Absolute path from filesystem root          | `//tmp/build` becomes `/tmp/build`     |
+| `~/`              | Relative to home directory                  | `~/.kube` becomes `$HOME/.kube`        |
+| `/`               | Relative to the settings file's directory   | `/build` becomes `$SETTINGS_DIR/build` |
+| `./` or no prefix | Relative path (resolved by sandbox runtime) | `./output`                             |
+
+You can also deny write or read access using `sandbox.filesystem.denyWrite` and `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead`. These are merged with any paths from `Edit(...)` and `Read(...)` permission rules.

 * **Permissions** control which tools Claude Code can use and are evaluated before any tool runs. They apply to all tools: Bash, Read, Edit, WebFetch, MCP, and others.
 * **Sandboxing** provides OS-level enforcement that restricts what Bash commands can access at the filesystem and network level. It applies only to Bash commands and their child processes.
