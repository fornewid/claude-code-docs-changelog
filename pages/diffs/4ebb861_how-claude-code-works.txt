 * **Default**: Claude asks before file edits and shell commands
 * **Auto-accept edits**: Claude edits files without asking, still asks for commands
 * **Plan mode**: Claude uses read-only tools only, creating a plan you can approve before execution
-* **Delegate mode**: Claude coordinates work through [agent teammates](/en/agent-teams) only, with no direct implementation. Only available when an agent team is active.
 
 You can also allow specific commands in `.claude/settings.json` so Claude doesn't ask each time. This is useful for trusted commands like `npm test` or `git status`. Settings can be scoped from organization-wide policies down to personal preferences. See [Permissions](/en/permissions) for details.
