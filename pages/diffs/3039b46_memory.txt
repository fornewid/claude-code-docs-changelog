-Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Imports are an alternative to CLAUDE.local.md that work better across multiple git worktrees.
+Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. Relative paths resolve relative to the file containing the import, not the working directory. For private per-project preferences that shouldn't be checked into version control, prefer `CLAUDE.local.md`: it is automatically loaded and added to `.gitignore`.
+
+If you work across multiple git worktrees, `CLAUDE.local.md` only exists in one. Use a home-directory import instead so all worktrees share the same personal instructions:
 
 ```
 # Individual Preferences
 - @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
 ```
 
+<Warning>
+  The first time Claude Code encounters external imports in a project, it shows an approval dialog listing the specific files. Approve to load them; decline to skip them. This is a one-time decision per project: once declined, the dialog does not resurface and the imports remain disabled.
+</Warning>
+
 To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.
