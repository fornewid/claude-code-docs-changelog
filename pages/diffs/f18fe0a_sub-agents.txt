 Subagents can run in the foreground (blocking) or background (concurrent):
 
 * **Foreground subagents** block the main conversation until complete. Permission prompts and clarifying questions (like [`AskUserQuestion`](/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude)) are passed through to you.
-* **Background subagents** run concurrently while you continue working. Before launching, Claude Code prompts for any tool permissions the subagent will need, ensuring it has the necessary approvals upfront. Once running, the subagent inherits these permissions and auto-denies anything not pre-approved. If a background subagent needs to ask clarifying questions, that tool call fails but the subagent continues. MCP tools are not available in background subagents.

 If a background subagent fails due to missing permissions, you can [resume it](#resume-subagents) in the foreground to retry with interactive prompts.
