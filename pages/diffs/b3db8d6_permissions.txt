 ## Managed settings
 
-For organizations that need centralized control over Claude Code configuration, administrators can deploy `managed-settings.json` files to system directories. These policy files follow the same format as regular settings files and cannot be overridden by user or project settings. For organizations without device management infrastructure, [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings) provide an alternative that delivers configurations from Anthropic's servers.

-**Managed settings file locations**:
+**MDM/OS-level policies**:
+
+* **macOS**: `com.anthropic.claudecode` managed preferences domain, deployed via configuration profiles
+* **Windows**: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\ClaudeCode` registry key with a `Settings` REG\_SZ value containing JSON
+* **Windows (user-level)**: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\ClaudeCode` (lowest policy priority)
+
+**Managed settings files**:
 
 * **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
 * **Linux and WSL**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
 * **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`
 
 <Note>
-  These are system-wide paths (not user home directories like `~/Library/...`) that require administrator privileges. They are designed to be deployed by IT administrators.
+  These are system-wide paths that require administrator privileges. Claude Code checks MDM/OS-level policies first, then falls back to managed settings files. Only one source is used.

 ### Managed-only settings
 
 Some settings are only effective in managed settings:
 
-| Setting                           | Description                                                                                                                                        |
-| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
-| `disableBypassPermissionsMode`    | Set to `"disable"` to prevent `bypassPermissions` mode and the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag                                               |
-| `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` | When `true`, prevents user and project settings from defining `allow`, `ask`, or `deny` permission rules. Only rules in managed settings apply     |
-| `allowManagedHooksOnly`           | When `true`, prevents loading of user, project, and plugin hooks. Only managed hooks and SDK hooks are allowed                                     |
-| `strictKnownMarketplaces`         | Controls which plugin marketplaces users can add. See [managed marketplace restrictions](/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions) |

+| `allow_remote_sessions`           | When `true`, allows users to start [Remote Control](/en/remote-control) and [web sessions](/en/claude-code-on-the-web). Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to prevent remote session access |
