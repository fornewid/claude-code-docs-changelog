 For example, if your user settings allow `Bash(npm run *)` but a project's shared settings deny it, the project setting takes precedence and the command is blocked.
 
+### Verify active settings
+
+Run `/status` inside Claude Code to see which settings sources are active and where they come from. The output shows each configuration layer (managed, user, project) along with its origin, such as `Enterprise managed settings (remote)`, `Enterprise managed settings (plist)`, `Enterprise managed settings (HKLM)`, or `Enterprise managed settings (file)`. If a settings file contains errors, `/status` reports the issue so you can fix it.

 ### Key points about the configuration system
 
 * **Memory files (`CLAUDE.md`)**: Contain instructions and context that Claude loads at startup
