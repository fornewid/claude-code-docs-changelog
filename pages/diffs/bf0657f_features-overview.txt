 **[Plugins](/en/plugins)** are the packaging layer. A plugin bundles skills, hooks, subagents, and MCP servers into a single installable unit. Plugin skills are namespaced (like `/my-plugin:review`) so multiple plugins can coexist. Use plugins when you want to reuse the same setup across multiple repositories or distribute to others via a **[marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces)**.

+    Both parallelize work, but they're architecturally different:
+
+    * **Subagents** run inside your session and report results back to your main context
+    * **Agent teams** are independent Claude Code sessions that communicate with each other
+
+    | Aspect            | Subagent                                         | Agent team                                          |
+    | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
+    | **Context**       | Own context window; results return to the caller | Own context window; fully independent               |
+    | **Communication** | Reports results back to the main agent only      | Teammates message each other directly               |
+    | **Coordination**  | Main agent manages all work                      | Shared task list with self-coordination             |
+    | **Best for**      | Focused tasks where only the result matters      | Complex work requiring discussion and collaboration |
+    | **Token cost**    | Lower: results summarized back to main context   | Higher: each teammate is a separate Claude instance |
+
+    **Use a subagent** when you need a quick, focused worker: research a question, verify a claim, review a file. The subagent does the work and returns a summary. Your main conversation stays clean.
+
+    **Use an agent team** when teammates need to share findings, challenge each other, and coordinate independently. Agent teams are best for research with competing hypotheses, parallel code review, and new feature development where each teammate owns a separate piece.
+
+    **Transition point:** If you're running parallel subagents but hitting context limits, or if your subagents need to communicate with each other, agent teams are the natural next step.
+
+    <Note>
+      Agent teams are experimental and disabled by default. See [agent teams](/en/agent-teams) for setup and current limitations.
