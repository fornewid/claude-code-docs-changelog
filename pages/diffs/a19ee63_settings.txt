 | `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`              | Set the percentage of context capacity (1-100) at which auto-compaction triggers. By default, auto-compaction triggers at approximately 95% capacity. Use lower values like `50` to compact earlier. Values above the default threshold have no effect. Applies to both main conversations and subagents. This percentage aligns with the `context_window.used_percentage` field available in [status line](/en/statusline)                                                                           |     |
