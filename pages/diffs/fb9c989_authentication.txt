 # Authentication
 
-> Learn how to configure user authentication and credential management for Claude Code in your organization.
+> Log in to Claude Code and configure authentication for individuals, teams, and organizations.
 
-## Authentication methods
+Claude Code supports multiple authentication methods depending on your setup. Individual users can log in with a Claude.ai account, while teams can use Claude for Teams or Enterprise, the Claude Console, or a cloud provider like Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry.
 
-Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of these ways:
+## Log in to Claude Code
 
-* [Claude for Teams or Enterprise](#claude-for-teams-or-enterprise) (recommended)
+After [installing Claude Code](/en/setup#install-claude-code), run `claude` in your terminal. On first launch, Claude Code opens a browser window for you to log in.
+
+If the browser doesn't open automatically, press `c` to copy the login URL to your clipboard, then paste it into your browser.
+
+You can authenticate with any of these account types:
+
+* **Claude Pro or Max subscription**: log in with your Claude.ai account. Subscribe at [claude.com/pricing](https://claude.com/pricing).
+* **Claude for Teams or Enterprise**: log in with the Claude.ai account your team admin invited you to.
+* **Claude Console**: log in with your Console credentials. Your admin must have [invited you](#claude-console-authentication) first.
+* **Cloud providers**: if your organization uses [Amazon Bedrock](/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Vertex AI](/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry](/en/microsoft-foundry), set the required environment variables before running `claude`. No browser login is needed.
+
+To log out and re-authenticate, type `/logout` at the Claude Code prompt.
+
+If you're having trouble logging in, see [authentication troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting#authentication-issues).
