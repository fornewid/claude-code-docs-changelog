 * `"allow"`: proceed without showing a permission prompt
 * `"deny"`: cancel the tool call and send the reason to Claude
 * `"ask"`: show the permission prompt to the user as normal
 
-For `UserPromptSubmit` hooks, use `additionalContext` instead to inject text into Claude's context. See [Control behavior with JSON output](/en/hooks#json-output) in the reference for the full JSON schema. Prompt-based hooks (`type: "prompt"`) handle output differently: see [Prompt-based hooks](#prompt-based-hooks).
+Other events use different decision patterns. For example, `PostToolUse` and `Stop` hooks use a top-level `decision: "block"` field, while `PermissionRequest` uses `hookSpecificOutput.decision.behavior`. See the [summary table](/en/hooks#decision-control) in the reference for a full breakdown by event.
