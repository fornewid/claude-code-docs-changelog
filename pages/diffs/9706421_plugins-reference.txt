 This reference provides complete technical specifications for the Claude Code plugin system, including component schemas, CLI commands, and development tools.
 
-## Plugin components reference
+A **plugin** is a self-contained directory of components that extends Claude Code with custom functionality. Plugin components include skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers.
 
-This section documents the types of components that plugins can provide.

 ## Plugin caching and file resolution
 
-For security and verification purposes, Claude Code copies plugins to a cache directory rather than using them in-place. Understanding this behavior is important when developing plugins that reference external files.
-
-### How plugin caching works
-
 Plugins are specified in one of two ways:
 
 * Through `claude --plugin-dir`, for the duration of a session.
-* Through a marketplace, installed to the local plugin cache.
-
-When you install a plugin, Claude Code locates its marketplace and the plugin's `source` field within that marketplace.
-
-The source can be one of five types:
+* Through a marketplace, installed for future sessions.
 
-* Relative path: copied recursively to the plugin cache. For example, if your marketplace entry specifies `"source": "./plugins/my-plugin"`, the entire `./plugins/my-plugin` directory is copied.
-* npm - copied to the plugin cache from npm
-* pip - copied to the plugin cache from pip
-* url - any https\:// URL ending in .git
-* github - any owner/repo shorthand
+For security and verification purposes, Claude Code copies *marketplace* plugins to the user's local **plugin cache** (`~/.claude/plugins/cache`) rather than using them in-place. Understanding this behavior is important when developing plugins that reference external files.
 
 ### Path traversal limitations
 
-Plugins cannot reference files outside their copied directory structure. Paths that traverse outside the plugin root (such as `../shared-utils`) will not work after installation because those external files are not copied to the cache.

 ### Working with external dependencies
 
-If your plugin needs to access files outside its directory, you have two options:
-
-**Option 1: Use symlinks**
-
-Create symbolic links to external files within your plugin directory. Symlinks are honored during the copy process:
+If your plugin needs to access files outside its directory, you can create symbolic links to external files within your plugin directory. Symlinks are honored during the copy process:
 
 ```bash  theme={null}
 # Inside your plugin directory
 ln -s /path/to/shared-utils ./shared-utils
 ```
 
-The symlinked content will be copied into the plugin cache.
-
-**Option 2: Restructure your marketplace**
-
-Set the plugin path to a parent directory that contains all required files, then provide the rest of the plugin manifest directly in the marketplace entry:
-
-```json  theme={null}
-{
-  "name": "my-plugin",
-  "source": "./",
-  "description": "Plugin that needs root-level access",
-  "commands": ["./plugins/my-plugin/commands/"],
-  "agents": ["./plugins/my-plugin/agents/"],
-  "strict": false
-}
-```
-
-This approach copies the entire marketplace root, giving your plugin access to sibling directories.
-
-<Note>
-  Symlinks that point to locations outside the plugin's logical root are followed during copying. This provides flexibility while maintaining the security benefits of the caching system.

+<Warning>
+  Claude Code uses the version to determine whether to update your plugin. If you change your plugin's code but don't bump the version in `plugin.json`, your plugin's existing users won't see your changes due to caching.
+
+  If your plugin is within a [marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces) directory, you can manage the version through `marketplace.json` instead and omit the `version` field from `plugin.json`.
