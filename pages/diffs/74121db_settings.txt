 ### Permission rule syntax
 
-Permission rules follow the format `Tool` or `Tool(specifier)`. Understanding the syntax helps you write rules that match exactly what you intend.
+Permission rules follow the format `Tool` or `Tool(specifier)`. Rules are evaluated in order: deny rules first, then ask, then allow. The first matching rule wins.
 
-#### Rule evaluation order
+Quick examples:
 
-When multiple rules could match the same tool use, rules are evaluated in this order:
+| Rule                           | Effect                                   |
+| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
+| `Bash`                         | Matches all Bash commands                |
+| `Bash(npm run *)`              | Matches commands starting with `npm run` |
+| `Read(./.env)`                 | Matches reading the `.env` file          |
+| `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` | Matches fetch requests to example.com    |
 
-1. **Deny** rules are checked first
-2. **Ask** rules are checked second
-3. **Allow** rules are checked last
-
-The first matching rule determines the behavior. This means deny rules always take precedence over allow rules, even if both match the same command.
-
-#### Matching all uses of a tool
-
-To match all uses of a tool, use just the tool name without parentheses:
-
-| Rule       | Effect                             |
-| :--------- | :--------------------------------- |
-| `Bash`     | Matches **all** Bash commands      |
-| `WebFetch` | Matches **all** web fetch requests |
-| `Read`     | Matches **all** file reads         |
-
-`Bash(*)` is equivalent to `Bash` and matches all Bash commands. Both syntaxes can be used interchangeably.
-
-#### Using specifiers for fine-grained control
-
-Add a specifier in parentheses to match specific tool uses:
-
-| Rule                           | Effect                                                   |
-| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
-| `Bash(npm run build)`          | Matches the exact command `npm run build`                |
-| `Read(./.env)`                 | Matches reading the `.env` file in the current directory |
-| `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` | Matches fetch requests to example.com                    |
-
-#### Wildcard patterns
-
-Bash rules support glob patterns with `*`. Wildcards can appear at any position in the command, including at the beginning, middle, or end. The following configuration allows npm and git commit commands while blocking git push:
-
-```json  theme={null}
-{
-  "permissions": {
-    "allow": [
-      "Bash(npm run *)",
-      "Bash(git commit *)",
-      "Bash(git * main)",
-      "Bash(* --version)",
-      "Bash(* --help *)"
-    ],
-    "deny": [
-      "Bash(git push *)"
-    ]
-  }
-}
-```
-
-The space before `*` matters: `Bash(ls *)` matches `ls -la` but not `lsof`, while `Bash(ls*)` matches both. The legacy `:*` suffix syntax (e.g., `Bash(npm run:*)`) is equivalent to ` *` but is deprecated.
-
-<Warning>
-  Bash permission patterns that try to constrain command arguments are fragile. For example, `Bash(curl http://github.com/ *)` intends to restrict curl to GitHub URLs, but won't match `curl -X GET http://github.com/...` (flags before URL), `curl https://github.com/...` (different protocol), or commands using shell variables. Do not rely on argument-constraining patterns as a security boundary. See [Bash permission limitations](/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for alternatives.
-</Warning>
-
-For detailed information about tool-specific permission patterns—including Read, Edit, WebFetch, MCP, Task rules, and Bash permission limitations—see [Tool-specific permission rules](/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules).
