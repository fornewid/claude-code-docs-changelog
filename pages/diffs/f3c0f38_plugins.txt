+### Ship default settings with your plugin
+
+Plugins can include a `settings.json` file at the plugin root to apply default configuration when the plugin is enabled. Currently, only the `agent` key is supported.
+
+Setting `agent` activates one of the plugin's [custom agents](/en/sub-agents) as the main thread, applying its system prompt, tool restrictions, and model. This lets a plugin change how Claude Code behaves by default when enabled.
+
+```json settings.json theme={null}
+{
+  "agent": "security-reviewer"
+}
+```
+
+This example activates the `security-reviewer` agent defined in the plugin's `agents/` directory. Settings from `settings.json` take priority over `settings` declared in `plugin.json`. Unknown keys are silently ignored.

 ### Organize complex plugins
 
 For plugins with many components, organize your directory structure by functionality. For complete directory layouts and organization patterns, see [Plugin directory structure](/en/plugins-reference#plugin-directory-structure).
