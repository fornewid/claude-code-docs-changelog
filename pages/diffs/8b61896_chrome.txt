 # Use Claude Code with Chrome (beta)
 
-> Connect Claude Code to your browser to test web apps, debug with console logs, and automate browser tasks.
+> Connect Claude Code to your Chrome browser to test web apps, debug with console logs, automate form filling, and extract data from web pages.
+
+Claude Code integrates with the Claude in Chrome browser extension to give you browser automation capabilities from the CLI or the [VS Code extension](/en/vs-code#automate-browser-tasks-with-chrome). Build your code, then test and debug in the browser without switching contexts.
+
+Claude opens new tabs for browser tasks and shares your browser's login state, so it can access any site you're already signed into. Browser actions run in a visible Chrome window in real time. When Claude encounters a login page or CAPTCHA, it pauses and asks you to handle it manually.
 
 <Note>
   Chrome integration is in beta and currently works with Google Chrome only. It is not yet supported on Brave, Arc, or other Chromium-based browsers. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is also not supported.

@@ -32,69 +32,63 @@ Before using Claude Code with Chrome, you need:
 
 * [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser
 * [Claude in Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn) version 1.0.36 or higher
-* [Claude Code CLI](/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code) version 2.0.73 or higher
-* A paid Claude plan (Pro, Team, or Enterprise)
-
-## How the integration works
-
-Claude Code communicates with Chrome through the Claude in Chrome browser extension. The extension uses Chrome's [Native Messaging API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) to receive commands from Claude Code and execute them in your browser. This architecture lets Claude Code control browser tabs, read page content, and perform actions while you continue working in your terminal.
-
-When Claude encounters a login page, CAPTCHA, or other blocker, it pauses and asks you to handle it. You can provide credentials for Claude to enter, or log in manually in the browser. Once you're past the blocker, tell Claude to continue and it picks up where it left off.
-
-Claude opens new tabs for browser tasks rather than taking over existing ones. However, it shares your browser's login state, so if you're already signed into a site in Chrome, Claude can access it without re-authenticating.
+* [Claude Code](/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code) version 2.0.73 or higher
+* A direct Anthropic plan (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)
 
 <Note>
-  The Chrome integration requires a visible browser window. When Claude performs browser actions, you'll see Chrome open and navigate in real time. There's no headless mode since the integration relies on your actual browser session with its login state.
+  Chrome integration is not available through third-party providers like Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry. If you access Claude exclusively through a third-party provider, you need a separate claude.ai account to use this feature.
 </Note>
 
-## Set up the integration
+## Get started in the CLI
 
 <Steps>
-  <Step title="Update Claude Code">
-    Chrome integration requires a recent version of Claude Code. If you installed using the [native installer](/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code), updates happen automatically. Otherwise, run:
+  <Step title="Launch Claude Code with Chrome">
+    Start Claude Code with the `--chrome` flag:

+    Go to code.claude.com/docs, click on the search box,
+    type "hooks", and tell me what results appear
     ```
   </Step>
-
-  <Step title="Verify the connection">
-    Run `/chrome` to check the connection status and manage settings. If the extension isn't detected, you'll see a warning with a link to install it.
-  </Step>
 </Steps>
 
-You can also enable Chrome integration from within an existing session using the `/chrome` command.
+Run `/chrome` at any time to check the connection status, manage permissions, or reconnect the extension.
 
-## Try it out
+For VS Code, see [browser automation in VS Code](/en/vs-code#automate-browser-tasks-with-chrome).
 
-Once connected, type this into Claude to see the integration in action:
+### Enable Chrome by default
 
-```
-Go to code.claude.com/docs, click on the search box,
-type "hooks", and tell me what results appear
-```
+To avoid passing `--chrome` each session, run `/chrome` and select "Enabled by default".
 
-Claude opens the page, clicks into the search field, types the query, and reports the autocomplete results. This shows navigation, clicking, and typing in a single workflow.
+In the [VS Code extension](/en/vs-code#automate-browser-tasks-with-chrome), Chrome is available whenever the Chrome extension is installed. No additional flag is needed.
 
-## Example workflows
+<Note>
+  Enabling Chrome by default in the CLI increases context usage since browser tools are always loaded. If you notice increased context consumption, disable this setting and use `--chrome` only when needed.

-Claude can navigate pages, click and type, fill forms, scroll, read console logs and network requests, manage tabs, resize windows, and record GIFs. Run `/mcp` and click into `claude-in-chrome` to see the full list of available tools.
+### Manage site permissions

-## Best practices
-
-When using browser automation, keep these guidelines in mind:
-
-* **Modal dialogs can interrupt the flow**: JavaScript alerts, confirms, and prompts block browser events and prevent Claude from receiving commands. If a dialog appears, dismiss it manually and tell Claude to continue.
-* **Use fresh tabs**: Claude creates new tabs for each session. If a tab becomes unresponsive, ask Claude to create a new one.
-* **Filter console output**: Console logs can be verbose. When debugging, tell Claude what patterns to look for rather than asking for all console output.

 ## Troubleshooting
 
 ### Extension not detected
 
 If Claude Code shows "Chrome extension not detected":
 
-1. Verify the Chrome extension (version 1.0.36 or higher) is installed
-2. Verify Claude Code is version 2.0.73 or higher by running `claude --version`
+1. Verify the Chrome extension is installed and enabled in `chrome://extensions`
+2. Verify Claude Code is up to date by running `claude --version`
 3. Check that Chrome is running
 4. Run `/chrome` and select "Reconnect extension" to re-establish the connection
 5. If the issue persists, restart both Claude Code and Chrome
 
+The first time you enable Chrome integration, Claude Code installs a native messaging host configuration file. Chrome reads this file on startup, so if the extension isn't detected on your first attempt, restart Chrome to pick up the new configuration.
+
+If the connection still fails, verify the host configuration file exists at:
+
+* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_code_browser_extension.json`
+* **Linux**: `~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_code_browser_extension.json`
+* **Windows**: check `HKCU\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\` in the Windows Registry
+
 ### Browser not responding

+3. Restart the Chrome extension by disabling and re-enabling it in `chrome://extensions`
 
-### First-time setup
+### Connection drops during long sessions
 
-The first time you use the integration, Claude Code installs a native messaging host that allows communication between the CLI and Chrome. If you encounter permission errors, you may need to restart Chrome for the installation to take effect.
+The Chrome extension's service worker can go idle during extended sessions, which breaks the connection. If browser tools stop working after a period of inactivity, run `/chrome` and select "Reconnect extension".
 
-## Enable by default
+### Windows-specific issues
 
-Chrome integration requires the `--chrome` flag each time you start Claude Code. To enable it by default, run `/chrome` and select "Enabled by default".
+On Windows, you may encounter:
 
-<Note>
-  Enabling Chrome by default increases context usage since browser tools are always loaded. If you notice increased context consumption, disable this setting and use `--chrome` only when needed.
-</Note>
+* **Named pipe conflicts (EADDRINUSE)**: if another process is using the same named pipe, restart Claude Code. Close any other Claude Code sessions that might be using Chrome.
+* **Native messaging host errors**: if the native messaging host crashes on startup, try reinstalling Claude Code to regenerate the host configuration.
+
+### Common error messages
+
+These are the most frequently encountered errors and how to resolve them:
 
-Site-level permissions are inherited from the Chrome extension. Manage permissions in the Chrome extension settings to control which sites Claude can browse, click, and type on. Run `/chrome` to see current permission settings.
