 # Changelog
 
+## 2.1.59
+
+- Claude automatically saves useful context to auto-memory. Manage with /memory
+- Added `/copy` command to show an interactive picker when code blocks are present, allowing selection of individual code blocks or the full response.
+- Improved "always allow" prefix suggestions for compound bash commands (e.g. `cd /tmp && git fetch && git push`) to compute smarter per-subcommand prefixes instead of treating the whole command as one
+- Improved ordering of short task lists
+- Improved memory usage in multi-agent sessions by releasing completed subagent task state
+- Fixed MCP OAuth token refresh race condition when running multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously
+- Fixed shell commands not showing a clear error message when the working directory has been deleted
