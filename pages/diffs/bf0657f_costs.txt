   When you first authenticate Claude Code with your Claude Console account, a workspace called "Claude Code" is automatically created for you. This workspace provides centralized cost tracking and management for all Claude Code usage in your organization. You cannot create API keys for this workspace; it is exclusively for Claude Code authentication and usage.

 For example, if you have 200 users, you might request 20k TPM for each user, or 4 million total TPM (200\*20,000 = 4 million).
 
-The TPM per user decreases as team size grows because we expect fewer users to use Claude Code concurrently in larger organizations. These rate limits apply at the organization level, not per individual user, which means individual users can temporarily consume more than their calculated share when others aren't actively using the service.

+### Agent team token costs
+
+[Agent teams](/en/agent-teams) spawn multiple Claude Code instances, each with its own context window. Token usage scales with the number of active teammates and how long each one runs.
+
+To keep agent team costs manageable:
+
+* Use Sonnet for teammates. It balances capability and cost for coordination tasks.
+* Keep teams small. Each teammate runs its own context window, so token usage is roughly proportional to team size.
+* Keep spawn prompts focused. Teammates load CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills automatically, but everything in the spawn prompt adds to their context from the start.
+* Clean up teams when work is done. Active teammates continue consuming tokens even if idle.
+* Agent teams are disabled by default. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in your [settings.json](/en/settings) or environment to enable them. See [enable agent teams](/en/agent-teams#enable-agent-teams).

 ## Reduce token usage
 
 Token costs scale with context size: the more context Claude processes, the more tokens you use. Claude Code automatically optimizes costs through prompt caching (which reduces costs for repeated content like system prompts) and auto-compaction (which summarizes conversation history when approaching context limits).

 ### Adjust extended thinking
 
-Extended thinking is enabled by default with a budget of 31,999 tokens because it significantly improves performance on complex planning and reasoning tasks. However, thinking tokens are billed as output tokens, so for simpler tasks where deep reasoning isn't needed, you can reduce costs by disabling it in `/config` or lowering the budget (for example, `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=8000`).

However, thinking tokens are billed as output tokens, so for simpler tasks where deep reasoning isn't needed, you can reduce costs by lowering the [effort level](/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) in `/model` for Opus 4.6, disabling thinking in `/config`, or lowering the budget (for example, `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=8000`).
 
 ### Delegate verbose operations to subagents
 
 Running tests, fetching documentation, or processing log files can consume significant context. Delegate these to [subagents](/en/sub-agents#isolate-high-volume-operations) so the verbose output stays in the subagent's context while only a summary returns to your main conversation.
 
+### Manage agent team costs
+
+Agent teams use approximately 7x more tokens than standard sessions when teammates run in plan mode, because each teammate maintains its own context window and runs as a separate Claude instance. Keep team tasks small and self-contained to limit per-teammate token usage. See [agent teams](/en/agent-teams) for details.

 ### Write specific prompts
 
 Vague requests like "improve this codebase" trigger broad scanning. Specific requests like "add input validation to the login function in auth.ts" let Claude work efficiently with minimal file reads.
