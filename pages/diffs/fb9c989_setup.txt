-</Tip>
+### Set up on Windows
+
+Claude Code on Windows requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) or WSL. You can launch `claude` from PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash. Claude Code uses Git Bash internally to run commands. You do not need to run PowerShell as Administrator.
 
-### Platform-specific setup
+**Option 1: Native Windows with Git Bash**
 
-**Windows**: Run Claude Code natively (requires [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)) or inside WSL. Both WSL 1 and WSL 2 are supported, but WSL 1 has limited support and does not support features like Bash tool sandboxing.
+Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win), then run the install command from PowerShell or CMD.
 
-**Alpine Linux and other musl/uClibc-based distributions**:
+If Claude Code can't find your Git Bash installation, set the path in your [settings.json file](/en/settings):
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "env": {
+    "CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
+  }
+}
+```
+
+**Option 2: WSL**
+
+Both WSL 1 and WSL 2 are supported. WSL 2 supports [sandboxing](/en/sandboxing) for enhanced security. WSL 1 does not support sandboxing.
+
+### Alpine Linux and musl-based distributions
 
 The native installer on Alpine and other musl/uClibc-based distributions requires `libgcc`, `libstdc++`, and `ripgrep`. Install these using your distribution's package manager, then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0`.
 
-On Alpine:
+This example installs the required packages on Alpine:
 
 ```bash  theme={null}
 apk add libgcc libstdc++ ripgrep
 ```
 
-### Authentication
+Then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP` to `0` in your [settings.json file](/en/settings#environment-variables):
 
-#### For individuals
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "env": {
+    "USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP": "0"
+  }
+}
+```
+
+## Verify your installation
+
+After installing, confirm Claude Code is working:
+
+```bash  theme={null}
+claude --version
+```
+
+For a more detailed check of your installation and configuration, run [`claude doctor`](/en/troubleshooting#get-more-help):
+
+```bash  theme={null}
+claude doctor
+```
+
+## Authenticate
+
+Claude Code requires a Pro, Max, Teams, Enterprise, or Console account. The free Claude.ai plan does not include Claude Code access. You can also use Claude Code with a third-party API provider like [Amazon Bedrock](/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Vertex AI](/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry](/en/microsoft-foundry).
+
+After installing, log in by running `claude` and following the browser prompts. See [Authentication](/en/authentication) for all account types and team setup options.
+
+## Update Claude Code
 
-1. **Claude Pro or Max plan** (recommended): Subscribe to Claude's [Pro or Max plan](https://claude.ai/pricing) for a unified subscription that includes both Claude Code and Claude on the web. Manage your account in one place and log in with your Claude.ai account.
-2. **Claude Console**: Connect through the [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com) and complete the OAuth process. Requires active billing in the Anthropic Console. A "Claude Code" workspace is automatically created for usage tracking and cost management. You can't create API keys for the Claude Code workspace; it's dedicated exclusively for Claude Code usage.
+Native installations automatically update in the background. You can [configure the release channel](#configure-release-channel) to control whether you receive updates immediately or on a delayed stable schedule, or [disable auto-updates](#disable-auto-updates) entirely. Homebrew and WinGet installations require manual updates.
 
-#### For teams and organizations
+### Auto-updates
 
-1. **Claude for Teams or Enterprise** (recommended): Subscribe to [Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) or [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales) for centralized billing, team management, and access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web. Team members log in with their Claude.ai accounts.
-2. **Claude Console with team billing**: Set up a shared [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com) organization with team billing. Invite team members and assign roles for usage tracking.
-3. **Cloud providers**: Configure Claude Code to use [Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry](/en/third-party-integrations) for deployments with your existing cloud infrastructure.
+Claude Code checks for updates on startup and periodically while running. Updates download and install in the background, then take effect the next time you start Claude Code.
+
+<Note>
+  Homebrew and WinGet installations do not auto-update. Use `brew upgrade claude-code` or `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` to update manually.
+
+  **Known issue:** Claude Code may notify you of updates before the new version is available in these package managers. If an upgrade fails, wait and try again later.
+
+  Homebrew keeps old versions on disk after upgrades. Run `brew cleanup claude-code` periodically to reclaim disk space.
+</Note>
+
+### Configure release channel
+
+Control which release channel Claude Code follows for auto-updates and `claude update` with the `autoUpdatesChannel` setting:
+
+* `"latest"`, the default: receive new features as soon as they're released
+* `"stable"`: use a version that is typically about one week old, skipping releases with major regressions
+
+Configure this via `/config` → **Auto-update channel**, or add it to your [settings.json file](/en/settings):
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "autoUpdatesChannel": "stable"
+}
+```
+
+For enterprise deployments, you can enforce a consistent release channel across your organization using [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings).
+
+### Disable auto-updates
+
+Set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` to `"1"` in the `env` key of your [settings.json file](/en/settings#environment-variables):
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "env": {
+    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
+  }
+}
+```
+
+### Update manually
+
+To apply an update immediately without waiting for the next background check, run:
+
+```bash  theme={null}
+claude update
+```
+
+## Advanced installation options
+
+These options are for version pinning, migrating from npm, and verifying binary integrity.
 
 ### Install a specific version
 
-The native installer accepts either a specific version number or a release channel (`latest` or `stable`). The channel you choose at install time becomes your default for auto-updates. See [Configure release channel](#configure-release-channel) for more information.
