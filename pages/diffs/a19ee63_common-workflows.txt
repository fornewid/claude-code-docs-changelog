 You can also ask Claude to "work in a worktree" or "start a worktree" during a session, and it will create one automatically.
 
+### Subagent worktrees

+Subagents can also use worktree isolation to work in parallel without conflicts. Ask Claude to "use worktrees for your agents" or configure it in a [custom subagent](/en/sub-agents#supported-frontmatter-fields) by adding `isolation: worktree` to the agent's frontmatter. Each subagent gets its own worktree that is automatically cleaned up when the subagent finishes without changes.

   Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project's setup. Depending on your stack, this might include running dependency installation (`npm install`, `yarn`), setting up virtual environments, or following your project's standard setup process.

+### Non-git version control
+
+Worktree isolation works with git by default. For other version control systems like SVN, Perforce, or Mercurial, configure [WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove hooks](/en/hooks#worktreecreate) to provide custom worktree creation and cleanup logic. When configured, these hooks replace the default git behavior when you use `--worktree`.

 For automated coordination of parallel sessions with shared tasks and messaging, see [agent teams](/en/agent-teams).
