 ### Use git worktrees for parallel tasks
 
-Git worktrees allow multiple Claude Code sessions to work on separate branches simultaneously, each with isolated files:
+Use the `--worktree` flag to start Claude in an isolated worktree with its own files and branch:
 
 ```bash  theme={null}
-# Create a worktree for a new feature
-git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a
-
-# Run Claude Code in each worktree
-cd ../project-feature-a && claude
+claude -w feature-auth
 ```
 
-Each worktree maintains independent file state while sharing git history. This prevents Claude instances from interfering with each other when working on different tasks.

-For detailed git workflows including PR reviews and branch management, see [Common workflows](/en/common-workflows#create-pull-requests).
