 By default, Claude Code requests permission for actions that might modify your system: file writes, Bash commands, MCP tools, etc. This is safe but tedious. After the tenth approval you're not really reviewing anymore, you're just clicking through. There are two ways to reduce these interruptions:
 
-* **Permission allowlists**: Permit specific tools you know are safe (like `npm run lint` or `git commit`)
