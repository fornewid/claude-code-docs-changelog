 # Extend Claude with skills
 
-> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom slash commands.
+> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom commands and bundled skills.
 
 Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.
 
 <Note>
   For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, see [interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands).
 
-  **Custom slash commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/review.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` both create `/review` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.

 Claude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context).
 
 ## Bundled skills
 
-Claude Code ships with two built-in skills available in every session:
+Bundled skills ship with Claude Code and are available in every session. Unlike [built-in commands](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands), which execute fixed logic directly, bundled skills are prompt-based: they give Claude a detailed playbook and let it orchestrate the work using its tools. This means bundled skills can spawn parallel agents, read files, and adapt to your codebase.
+
+You invoke bundled skills the same way as any other skill: type `/` followed by the skill name.
 
 * **`/simplify`**: reviews your recently changed files for code reuse, quality, and efficiency issues, then fixes them. Run it after implementing a feature or bug fix to clean up your work. It spawns three review agents in parallel (code reuse, code quality, efficiency), aggregates their findings, and applies fixes. Pass optional text to focus on specific concerns: `/simplify focus on memory efficiency`.
 
 * **`/batch <instruction>`**: orchestrates large-scale changes across a codebase in parallel. Provide a description of the change and `/batch` researches the codebase, decomposes the work into 5 to 30 independent units, and presents a plan for your approval. Once approved, it spawns one background agent per unit, each in an isolated [git worktree](/en/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees). Each agent implements its unit, runs tests, and opens a pull request. Requires a git repository. Example: `/batch migrate src/ from Solid to React`.
 
+* **`/debug [description]`**: troubleshoots your current Claude Code session by reading the session debug log. Optionally describe the issue to focus the analysis.
+
+Claude Code also includes a bundled developer platform skill that activates automatically when your code imports the Anthropic SDK. You don't need to invoke it manually.
