   **How plugins are installed**: When users install a plugin, Claude Code copies the plugin directory to a cache location. This means plugins can't reference files outside their directory using paths like `../shared-utils`, because those files won't be copied.
 
-  If you need to share files across plugins, use symlinks (which are followed during copying) or restructure your marketplace so the shared directory is inside the plugin source path. See [Plugin caching and file resolution](/en/plugins-reference#plugin-caching-and-file-resolution) for details.

+  **Marketplace sources vs plugin sources**: These are different concepts that control different things.
+
+  * **Marketplace source** — where to fetch the `marketplace.json` catalog itself. Set when users run `/plugin marketplace add` or in `extraKnownMarketplaces` settings. Supports `ref` (branch/tag) but not `sha`.
+  * **Plugin source** — where to fetch an individual plugin listed in the marketplace. Set in the `source` field of each plugin entry inside `marketplace.json`. Supports both `ref` (branch/tag) and `sha` (exact commit).
+
+  For example, a marketplace hosted at `acme-corp/plugin-catalog` (marketplace source) can list a plugin fetched from `acme-corp/code-formatter` (plugin source). The marketplace source and plugin source point to different repositories and are pinned independently.

+### Strict mode
+
+The `strict` field controls whether `plugin.json` is the authority for component definitions (commands, agents, hooks, skills, MCP servers, output styles).
+
+| Value            | Behavior                                                                                                                                                         |

+**When to use each mode:**
+
+* **`strict: true`**: the plugin has its own `plugin.json` and manages its own components. The marketplace entry can add extra commands or hooks on top. This is the default and works for most plugins.
+* **`strict: false`**: the marketplace operator wants full control. The plugin repo provides raw files, and the marketplace entry defines which of those files are exposed as commands, agents, hooks, etc. Useful when the marketplace restructures or curates a plugin's components differently than the plugin author intended.

+### Version resolution and release channels
+
+Plugin versions determine cache paths and update detection. You can specify the version in the plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) or in the marketplace entry (`marketplace.json`).
+
+<Warning>
+  When possible, avoid setting the version in both places. The plugin manifest always wins silently, which can cause the marketplace version to be ignored. For relative-path plugins, set the version in the marketplace entry. For all other plugin sources, set it in the plugin manifest.
+</Warning>
+
+#### Set up release channels
+
+To support "stable" and "latest" release channels for your plugins, you can set up two marketplaces that point to different refs or SHAs of the same repo. You can then assign the two marketplaces to different user groups through [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files).
+
+<Warning>
+  The plugin's `plugin.json` must declare a different `version` at each pinned ref or commit. If two refs or commits have the same manifest version, Claude Code treats them as identical and skips the update.
+</Warning>
+
+##### Example
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "name": "stable-tools",
+  "plugins": [
+    {
+      "name": "code-formatter",
+      "source": {
+        "source": "github",
+        "repo": "acme-corp/code-formatter",
+        "ref": "stable"
+      }
+    }
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "name": "latest-tools",
+  "plugins": [
+    {
+      "name": "code-formatter",
+      "source": {
+        "source": "github",
+        "repo": "acme-corp/code-formatter",
+        "ref": "latest"
+      }
+    }
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+##### Assign channels to user groups
+
+Assign each marketplace to the appropriate user group through managed settings. For example, the stable group receives:
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
+    "stable-tools": {
+      "source": {
+        "source": "github",
+        "repo": "acme-corp/stable-tools"
+      }
+    }
+  }
+}
+```
+
+The early-access group receives `latest-tools` instead:
+
+```json  theme={null}
+{
+  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
+    "latest-tools": {
+      "source": {
+        "source": "github",
+        "repo": "acme-corp/latest-tools"
+      }
+    }
+  }
+}
+```
