 ## Managed settings
 
-For organizations that need centralized control over Claude Code configuration, administrators can deploy managed settings through several mechanisms. These policy settings follow the same format as regular settings files and cannot be overridden by user or project settings. For organizations without device management infrastructure, [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings) provide an alternative that delivers configurations from Anthropic's servers.
-
-**MDM/OS-level policies**:
-
-* **macOS**: `com.anthropic.claudecode` managed preferences domain, deployed via configuration profiles
-* **Windows**: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\ClaudeCode` registry key with a `Settings` REG\_SZ value containing JSON
-* **Windows (user-level)**: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\ClaudeCode` (lowest policy priority)
-
-**Managed settings files**:
-
-* **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
-* **Linux and WSL**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
-* **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`

-<Note>
-  These are system-wide paths that require administrator privileges. Claude Code checks MDM/OS-level policies first, then falls back to managed settings files. Only one source is used.

+For organizations that need centralized control over Claude Code configuration, administrators can deploy managed settings that cannot be overridden by user or project settings. These policy settings follow the same format as regular settings files and can be delivered through MDM/OS-level policies, managed settings files, or [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings). See [settings files](/en/settings#settings-files) for delivery mechanisms and file locations.
 
 ### Managed-only settings
 
 Some settings are only effective in managed settings:
 
-| Setting                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
-| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

-| `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` | When `true`, prevents user and project settings from defining `allow`, `ask`, or `deny` permission rules. Only rules in managed settings apply                                              |

-| `allow_remote_sessions`           | When `true`, allows users to start [Remote Control](/en/remote-control) and [web sessions](/en/claude-code-on-the-web). Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to prevent remote session access |
