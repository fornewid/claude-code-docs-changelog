 **With other models**, thinking uses a fixed budget of up to 31,999 tokens from your output budget. You can limit this with the [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`](/en/settings#environment-variables) environment variable, or disable thinking entirely via `/config` or the `Option+T`/`Alt+T` toggle.
 
-`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` is ignored when using Opus 4.6, since adaptive reasoning controls thinking depth instead. The one exception: setting `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` still disables thinking entirely on any model.
+`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` is ignored on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, since adaptive reasoning controls thinking depth instead. The one exception: setting `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` still disables thinking entirely on any model. To disable adaptive thinking and revert to the fixed thinking budget, set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1`. See [environment variables](/en/settings#environment-variables).

   You're charged for all thinking tokens used, even though Claude 4 models show summarized thinking
