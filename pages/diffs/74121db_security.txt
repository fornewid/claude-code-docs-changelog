 We designed Claude Code to be transparent and secure. For example, we require approval for bash commands before executing them, giving you direct control. This approach enables users and organizations to configure permissions directly.

   **Windows WebDAV security risk**: When running Claude Code on Windows, we recommend against enabling WebDAV or allowing Claude Code to access paths such as `\\*` that may contain WebDAV subdirectories. [WebDAV has been deprecated by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features#:~:text=The%20Webclient%20\(WebDAV\)%20service%20is%20deprecated) due to security risks. Enabling WebDAV may allow Claude Code to trigger network requests to remote hosts, bypassing the permission system.
