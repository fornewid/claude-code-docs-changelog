 The best results come from tight feedback loops. Though Claude occasionally solves problems perfectly on the first attempt, correcting it quickly generally produces better solutions faster.

 Instead of carefully planning every move, you can tell Claude to try something risky. If it doesn't work, rewind and try a different approach. Checkpoints persist across sessions, so you can close your terminal and still rewind later.
