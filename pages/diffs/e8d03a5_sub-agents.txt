 #### Restrict which subagents can be spawned
 
-When an agent runs as the main thread with `claude --agent`, it can spawn subagents using the Task tool. To restrict which subagent types it can spawn, use `Task(agent_type)` syntax in the `tools` field:

 This is an allowlist: only the `worker` and `researcher` subagents can be spawned. If the agent tries to spawn any other type, the request fails and the agent sees only the allowed types in its prompt. To block specific agents while allowing all others, use [`permissions.deny`](#disable-specific-subagents) instead.
