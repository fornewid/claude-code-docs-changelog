+Type `/` in Claude Code to see all available commands, or type `/` followed by any letters to filter. Not all commands are visible to every user. Some depend on your platform, plan, or environment. For example, `/desktop` only appears on macOS and Windows, `/upgrade` and `/privacy-settings` are only available on Pro and Max plans, and `/terminal-setup` is hidden when your terminal natively supports its keybindings.
