 | `alwaysThinkingEnabled`      | Enable [extended thinking](/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) by default for all sessions. Typically configured via the `/config` command rather than editing directly                                                                                   | `true`                                                                  |
 | `plansDirectory`             | Customize where plan files are stored. Path is relative to project root. Default: `~/.claude/plans`                                                                                                                                                                             | `"./plans"`                                                             |
 | `showTurnDuration`           | Show turn duration messages after responses (e.g., "Cooked for 1m 6s"). Set to `false` to hide these messages                                                                                                                                                                   | `true`                                                                  |
+| `spinnerVerbs`               | Customize the action verbs shown in the spinner and turn duration messages. Set `mode` to `"replace"` to use only your verbs, or `"append"` to add them to the defaults                                                                                                         | `{"mode": "append", "verbs": ["Pondering", "Crafting"]}`                |
 | `language`                   | Configure Claude's preferred response language (e.g., `"japanese"`, `"spanish"`, `"french"`).

 | `autoUpdatesChannel`         | Release channel to follow for updates. Use `"stable"` for a version that is typically about one week old and skips versions with major regressions, or `"latest"` (default) for the most recent release                                                                         | `"stable"`                                                              |
 | `spinnerTipsEnabled`         | Show tips in the spinner while Claude is working. Set to `false` to disable tips (default: `true`)                                                                                                                                                                              | `false`                                                                 |
