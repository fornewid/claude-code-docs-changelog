 Claude Code automatically tracks Claude's file edits as you work, allowing you to quickly undo changes and rewind to previous states if anything gets off track.

 * Checkpoints persist across sessions, so you can access them in resumed conversations
 * Automatically cleaned up along with sessions after 30 days (configurable)

+Press `Esc` twice (`Esc` + `Esc`) or use the `/rewind` command to open the rewind menu. A scrollable list shows each of your prompts from the session. Select the point you want to act on, then choose an action:
 
-* **Conversation only**: Rewind to a user message while keeping code changes
-* **Code only**: Revert file changes while keeping the conversation
-* **Both code and conversation**: Restore both to a prior point in the session
+* **Restore code and conversation**: revert both code and conversation to that point
+* **Restore conversation**: rewind to that message while keeping current code
+* **Restore code**: revert file changes while keeping the conversation
+* **Summarize from here**: compress the conversation from this point forward into a summary, freeing context window space
+* **Never mind**: return to the message list without making changes
+
+After restoring the conversation or summarizing, the original prompt from the selected message is restored into the input field so you can re-send or edit it.
+
+#### Restore vs. summarize
+
+The three restore options revert state: they undo code changes, conversation history, or both. "Summarize from here" works differently:
+
+* Messages before the selected message stay intact
+* The selected message and all subsequent messages get replaced with a compact AI-generated summary
+* No files on disk are changed
+* The original messages are preserved in the session transcript, so Claude can reference the details if needed
+
+This is similar to `/compact`, but targeted: instead of summarizing the entire conversation, you keep early context in full detail and only compress the parts that are using up space. You can type optional instructions to guide what the summary focuses on.
 
 ## Common use cases
 
 Checkpoints are particularly useful when:
 
-* **Exploring alternatives**: Try different implementation approaches without losing your starting point
-* **Recovering from mistakes**: Quickly undo changes that introduced bugs or broke functionality
-* **Iterating on features**: Experiment with variations knowing you can revert to working states

+* **Freeing context space**: summarize a verbose debugging session from the midpoint forward, keeping your initial instructions intact
