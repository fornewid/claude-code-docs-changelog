 | `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`                     | Set the effort level for supported models. Values: `low`, `medium`, `high` (default). Lower effort is faster and cheaper, higher effort provides deeper reasoning. Currently supported with Opus 4.6 only. See [Adjust effort level](/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |     |
