-Extended thinking is particularly valuable for complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, multi-step implementation planning, and evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches. It provides more space for exploring multiple solutions, analyzing edge cases, and self-correcting mistakes.
+Additionally, Opus 4.6 introduces adaptive reasoning: instead of a fixed thinking token budget, the model dynamically allocates thinking based on your [effort level](/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) setting. Extended thinking and adaptive reasoning work together to give you control over how deeply Claude reasons before responding.

-### How extended thinking token budgets work
-
-Extended thinking uses a **token budget** that controls how much internal reasoning Claude can perform before responding.
-
-A larger thinking token budget provides:
+### How extended thinking works
 
-* More space to explore multiple solution approaches step-by-step
-* Room to analyze edge cases and evaluate tradeoffs thoroughly
-* Ability to revise reasoning and self-correct mistakes
+Extended thinking controls how much internal reasoning Claude performs before responding. More thinking provides more space to explore solutions, analyze edge cases, and self-correct mistakes.
 
-Token budgets for thinking mode:
+**With Opus 4.6**, thinking uses adaptive reasoning: the model dynamically allocates thinking tokens based on the [effort level](/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) you select (low, medium, high, max). This is the recommended way to tune the tradeoff between speed and reasoning depth.
 
-* When thinking is **enabled**, Claude can use up to **31,999 tokens** from your output budget for internal reasoning
-* When thinking is **disabled** (via toggle or `/config`), Claude uses **0 tokens** for thinking
+**With other models**, thinking uses a fixed budget of up to 31,999 tokens from your output budget. You can limit this with the [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`](/en/settings#environment-variables) environment variable, or disable thinking entirely via `/config` or the `Option+T`/`Alt+T` toggle.
 
-**Limit the thinking budget:**
-
-* Use the [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` environment variable](/en/settings#environment-variables) to cap the thinking budget
-* When set, this value limits the maximum tokens Claude can use for thinking
-* See the [extended thinking documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for valid token ranges
+`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` is ignored when using Opus 4.6, since adaptive reasoning controls thinking depth instead. The one exception: setting `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` still disables thinking entirely on any model.
