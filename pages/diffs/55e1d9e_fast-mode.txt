-Fast mode delivers faster Opus 4.6 responses at a higher cost per token. Toggle it on with `/fast` when you need speed for interactive work like rapid iteration or live debugging, and toggle it off when cost matters more than latency.
+Fast mode is a high-speed configuration for Claude Opus 4.6, making the model 2.5x faster at a higher cost per token. Toggle it on with `/fast` when you need speed for interactive work like rapid iteration or live debugging, and toggle it off when cost matters more than latency.
 
 Fast mode is not a different model. It uses the same Opus 4.6 with a different API configuration that prioritizes speed over cost efficiency. You get identical quality and capabilities, just faster responses.
